title: Introductory Thoughts 
---

Hello! If you're reading this, you're hopefully interested in my blog. To
be quite honest I'm not sure yet what it is I'm going to put on here, but
I'm hopeful the quality will be nice enough to justify your stay.

### Some recent going ons in my life that I may or may not write about

1. I have started to move away from microwaved frozen foods and other junk
   altogether. We'll see if it sticks, and I can introduce a more health
   conscious attitude into my diet and life. Lord knows I need it. 

2. I finished playing Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun for a second time.
   Honestly it's one of the best games I've played this year, though
   I haven't really played all that much video games. No, I have not
   played Tears of the Kingdom

3. Not quite my life exactly but the [Reddit
   protest](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/20/23767098/reddit-subreddits-porn-protest)
   has had some very concerning (and hopeful!) developments. When the dust
   settles I intend fully to provide commentary on it. BTW fuck u/spez.

That's all I have right now. Have a good one, and I hope you see yourself
well.
